## Project description

### Data analysis for the paper (in review):
“Variation in echolocation call emission of Neotropical insect-eating bats in response to shifting ambient temperatures.” Journal of Experimental Biology.

## General info
In this study we tested vespertilionid bats' short-term adjustments of call parameters in response to an experimentally increased ambient temperature in a mountainous area of the Neotropics. 

## Data
* [Data](https://github.com/morceglo/Vocal-interactions-Thyroptera-tricolor/tree/main/data) 
AA_DD_30.csv; AA_DD_20.csv, and AA_DD_10.csv are the data sets containing echolocation call parameters, Atmospheric Attenuation and Detection Distance. AA_DD_30 contains Detection Distance calculated for small prey such as dipterans (~10 mm2, TS: -30 dB), AA_DD_20 contains Detection Distance calculated for small moths (~20 mm2, TS: -20 dB) and AA_DD_10 contains Detection Distance calculated for medium size moth, (~30 mm2, TS: -10 dB)

AA_RH100, AA_RH75, and AA_RH50 are the data sets with fixed values of Relative Humidity (100%, 75%, and 50% respectively). We used these data sets to investigate the effect of high, medium, and low relative humidity scenarios on Atmospheric Attenuation.
